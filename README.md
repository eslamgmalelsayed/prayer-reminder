## API Used

This app uses the [Aladhan Prayer Times API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) to fetch accurate prayer times based on your location.

## Notifications

The app requests permission for local notifications to remind you of prayer times. Make sure to allow notifications when prompted.

## Troubleshooting

- **Node.js version error**: Update to Node.js v18 or later
- **Location not detected**: The app will fall back to Mecca, Saudi Arabia
- **Notifications not working**: Check if notification permissions are granted in your device settings
- **APK build fails**: Ensure Android Studio and JDK are properly installed

## Customization

You can customize the prayer calculation method by modifying the API call in `src/views/Home.vue`. The current method uses the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) method.
